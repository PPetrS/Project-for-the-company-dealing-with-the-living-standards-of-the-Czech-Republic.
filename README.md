# Project-living-standards-of-the-Czech-Republic

In the analytical department of a company that deals with the living standards of citizens, you have agreed to try to answer a few defined research questions that address the availability of basic foodstuffs to the general public. 

Colleagues have already defined the basic questions they will try to answer and provide this information to the press department. This department will present the results at the next conference focusing on this area.

To do this, they need to prepare robust data from you, which will show a comparison of food availability based on average incomes over a period of time.

Research questions:

1) Have wages been rising over the years in all sectors, or falling in some?

2) How many litres of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?

3) Which food category is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (has the lowest percentage increase year on year)?

4) Is there a year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (greater than 10%)?
